Problem 4, Assignment 3
COMP 3211, 2018 Fall, HKUST

Author: Gerald Liu

Definitions (Foo, Bar are in { Lisa, Bob, Jim, Mary }):
FooBar = Foo is ranked immediately ahead of Bar
BioFoo = Foo is a biology major

The program will output the variables that are true and analyze the result.
Expected output (with Python 3):

>>> python ranking.py
MaryBob = True
JimLisa = True
BioLisa = True
BobJim = True

Therefore, the ranking is: Mary, Bob, Jim, Lisa.
